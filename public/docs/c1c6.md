# TIMEDB c1-c6 subtyping
# Introduction
Being part of the “Immune Landscape of Cancer”, ImmuneSubtypeClassifier is an immune subtype predictor which accepts RNA-seq data as input, and predicts the probability of a patient being six immune statuses, including C1 (wound healing), C2 (IFN-γ dominant), C3 (inflammatory), C4 (lymphocyte depleted), C5 (immunologically quiet), and C6 (TGF-β dominant). ImmuneSubtypeClassifier is an ensemble model based on XGBoost and trained on TCGA gene expression profiles.

## Input file
`Gene expression data`(**required**):the gene expression file(CSV)

*  The first row should be a header with a 'GeneSymbol' column label followed by the sample name.
*  The first column should be the gene symbol(HGNC ID). The HGNC ID could be found on [HGNC website](https://www.genenames.org/).
* The data type of reading count should be a number. 

## Set parameters
- `Project name`(**required**): Set the name of this data. The C1-C6 subtyping result will be named as "Project name\_subtyping\_c1-c6.csv".

&emsp;
## Results
### C1\_C6 subtyping file(CSV)
The C1\_C6 subtyping result file:
- The first row is a header with a 'SampleID' column label followed by the sample name.
### Visualization
Each bar represents a sample, and each color represents the possibility of one immune subtype.
